<Info>
We currently only support **crypto** at the moment. However, we will explore additional deposit methods in the future. 
</Info>

### **Crypto**
- A unique wallet will be generated for you upon account creation. This wallet will allow you to deposit as much `crypto_name` as you need, our website will automatically park your funds in your designated unique wallet until you decide to convert. 

<Info>
All deposits incur a fee to maintain the platform, be sure to check out the [fees](https://docs.royalty.gg/fees) page to understand the fee structure.

<Warning>
It is not recommended to deposit and leave your funds without converting, we will automatically refund you your deposit in 7 days if you do not convert by then.
</Warning>

- Once you have successfully deposited, your balance will show up after `x` confirmations, and you will be ready to convert to your Buff balance!

## **Step 3:** Convert your funds into Buff

- On the right hand panel, you will see the amount available to convert, as well as the RMB amount you will receive after conversion. In this example, we will be converting `$10,000 USD` to showcase the overall process.

<Tip>
Buff has a restriction of **50,000 RMB each deposit**, so if you click `max` when converting, we will only convert exactly **50,000 RMB** of your balance to convert.

**You'll need to repeat the conversion process if you wish to convert over 50,000 RMB.**
