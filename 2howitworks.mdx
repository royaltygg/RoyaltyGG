**Step 2:** Choose your deposit method
<Info>
We currently only support **crypto** at the moment. However, we will explore additional deposit methods in the future. 
<Info>

**Crypto**
- A unique wallet will be generated for you upon account creation. This wallet will allow you to deposit as much `crypto_name` as you need, our website will automatically park your funds in your designated unique wallet until you decide to convert. 

<Info>
All deposits incur a fee to maintain the platform, be sure to check out the [fees](https://docs.royalty.gg/fees) page to understand the fee structure.
<Info>

<Warning>
It is not recommended to deposit and leave your funds without converting, we will automatically refund you your deposit in 7 days if you do not convert by then.
<Warning>

- Once you have successfully deposited, your balance will show up after `x` confirmations, and you’ll be ready to convert to your Buff balance!
- On the right hand panel, you’ll see the amount available to convert, as well as the RMB amount you’ll receive after conversion. In this example, we’ll be converting `$10,000 USD` to showcase the overall process.

<Tip>
Buff has a restriction of **50,000 RMB each deposit**, so if you click `max` when converting, we will only convert exactly **50,000 RMB** of your balance to convert.

You'll need to repeat the conversion process if you wish to convert over **50,000 RMB.**
