Royalty is a centralized P2B (Peer-to-Business) balance purchasing platform to help users deposit/top up their Buff accounts to purchase CSGO skins.

Royalty provides a fully self-serving platform that allows users to deposit via crypto (potentially more soon?) and instantly obtain their desired Buff balance via Alipay to obtain the skins they want. This process is seamless and efficient for users to obtain their balance without the hassle or risk of 1:1 transacting with another human.

<Info>
  **Did you know?** 

Buff will lock/disable your account if you have deposited with various different Alipay accounts?

Do not sweat! Royalty will manage and prevent users from getting restricted by Buff.
