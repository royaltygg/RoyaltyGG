When you deposit crypto into Royalty, fees are charged depending on your deposit amount **and** loyalty level. These fees are calculated at the time you deposit and can be influenced by external costs we incur to facilitate your transaction.

<Warning>
Before submitting your deposit, make sure you view the fees on this page.
</Warning>

## Deposit Fees

Deposit fees are calculated purely off your deposit amount. Below is a chart that lists all the deposit ranges and their respective transaction fees.

<Warning>
Loyalty discounts are not % off (how traditional % discounts work). Instead, they are the **face value that gets subtracted** from the transaction fee.
</Warning>

### Example

User A is **depositing** `$8,000`. User A has **previously deposited** a cumulative total of `$2,000`. Based on the deposit fee chart above, User A will incur a `6.7%` **transaction fee**. Now based on the loyalty chart above, User A will recieve `0.35%` **subtracted** from the transacion fee of 6.7%. This results in a final deposit fee of `6.35%` (6.7% - 0.35%).
