When you deposit crypto into Royalty, fees are charged depending on your deposit amount **and** loyalty level. These fees are calculated at the time you deposit and can be influenced by external costs we incur to facilitate your transaction.

<Warning>
Before submitting your deposit, make sure you view the fees on this page.
